// The map's canvas: MapLibre with the basemap style, repainted when the theme changes, when the
// timetable's network has loaded and when the highlight changes, and the live vehicles in deck.gl's
// canvas over it (docs/screens.md, "The moving map"; ADR 0003). It opens on the view the address
// names and keeps where it was left in the address (`view.ts`), except while Follow moves it each
// frame. A new highlight ends Follow and fits the camera to it, clear of the top bar, the notices
// and the legend the screen hands it, moving only the centre and zoom, so a tilted, turned map
// keeps its tilt and heading, as it does under Follow; a flight to a trip from the Latest now pill
// lands its dot clear of the same, the panel included, wherever a snapshot moves it meanwhile
// (spotlight.ts). The map lives outside React: React only names the canvas, and the screen's
// controls move it through the camera (camera.ts). The address keeps its heading and tilt too, so a
// link opens in 3D. Its tilt and heading at rest are on its container as `data-tilt` and
// `data-heading`, for tests.
