// The overlay on the map: deck.gl's own canvas over MapLibre's (ADR 0003), drawing each kind of
// thing on it, the live snapshot's vehicles and, above them, the live aircraft, in one render a
// frame, which the frame driver (frames.ts) runs. The vehicles, less the modes the viewer's
// filters hide, are where their motion (loop.ts) moves them each frame, and the aircraft, unless
// the Planes filter hides them, where theirs (aircraft-loop.ts) does, with each kind's glyphs made
// again when its snapshot lands, a data state turns by the clock, a filter or the theme changes;
// every dot's size where the zoom puts it, and each one where the camera draws it however the
// map is turned or tilted. A hover picks a dot of either kind (picking.ts), a tap on one opens its
// panel, and a tap that finds no dot opens the stop under it, if any.
// Each frame drawn moves the camera onto the followed dot (follow.ts). It polls the snapshot while
// the map is open, and the aircraft while the Planes filter shows them too. The numbers of
// vehicles and aircraft drawn are on the map's container as `data-vehicles` and `data-aircraft`,
// for tests.
