# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle: consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` so test names and interface vocabulary match Mylder's domain language, and respect the ADRs in `docs/adr/` for the area you're touching.

In Mylder, a test is a Vitest file beside its module, run by `npm test`, or a Playwright journey in `e2e/`, run by `npm run test:e2e`. [docs/testing-seams.md](../../../docs/testing-seams.md) names the seams (the recorded `HttpClient` layer and Effect's `Clock`) and what each kind of test looks like: read it before the first test.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything, so agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?" Give each proposed seam a one-line note on what it catches and what it misses.

When the spec or ticket you are building already names its seams (a spec's Testing Decisions, or `docs/testing-seams.md`), those are the confirmed seams, so the factory's implementer starts the loop without asking.

When the shape of that interface is itself in question (how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose), call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: an assertion that cannot go _red_, so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. It takes one of three shapes:
  - the expected value is worked out the way the code works it out: by calling the code under test or a helper it calls, or by repeating its logic (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`; `expect(count()).toBe(items().length)` where `count` returns `items().length`; a snapshot derived by hand the same way);
  - the test asserts nothing, or only what it wrote itself: a literal (`expect(true).toBe(true)`), a constant against itself, a fixture that never went through the code;
  - every assertion is on a mock the test set up and then called itself, so the code under test never runs.

  Expected values come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec, or a second source that agrees for a reason of its own (a changelog's top version against `package.json`'s). Before keeping an assertion, name the wrong code that would turn it red; when nothing can, give it an independent expected value, or delete it.

- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (see the `factory-code-review` skill), not the red → green implementation cycle.
