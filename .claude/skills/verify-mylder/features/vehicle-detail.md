# Vehicle detail

A panel for one trip: line badge and destination, its data state with one line of explanation, delay, last seen and next stop, where it is, its next stops, Follow and Show whole line, and a source line. It is kept in the address as `?trip=<key>`.

## Sub-features

- `trip-open` opens from a dot, a Vehicles list row, or a shared link.
- `trip-facts` shows state, delay, last seen, next stop and the next stops.
- `trip-follow` keeps the camera on the dot, at the map's tilt and heading, until the rider pans, the panel closes or the trip reaches its last stop, or a press on the Latest now pill flies the map to a trip (`latest-spotlight` in [`latest-right-now.md`](./latest-right-now.md)).
- `trip-line` fits the whole line clear of the top bar, the notices and the legend, at the map's tilt and heading, and raises the highlight chip.
- `trip-close` closes with Esc or the close button and drops `?trip=`.
- `trip-missing` opens a not-found panel for an unknown trip.
- `trip-timetable` on the timetable source lists the stops at their planned times with no delay or expected time, and names the timetable as the source: "Timetable · placed 08:14:05".
- `trip-delays` with SIRI-ET's delays gives an updated trip's delay at its next stop, late or early, its stops' expected times marked "~", the stops it skips Cancelled, and the source line "Timetable and Rejseplanen's delays · updated 09:21:43", its latest update's time.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Tap a dot on the map.
- Choose a row's destination link in the Vehicles list.
- Open a shared link with `?trip=<key>`.

## Driving it with drive.ts

Preconditions:

- Baseline.

- **From the list.** `page.goto('/en')`, `page.getByRole('dialog', { name: 'Overview' }).getByRole('tab', { name: /^Vehicles/ }).click()`, then the first row's link in `getByRole('table', { name: 'Vehicles' })`. A dialog named `/ to <destination>/` opens and the address has `?trip=`.
- **From a dot.** Centre the map on a trip's `position` from `/api/snapshot` with `?map=15.00/<lat>/<lon>` and tap the middle until the dialog named `/to <headsign>/` is visible.
- **Facts.** The panel shows the mode, the state word, `Delay`, `Last seen`, `Next stop`, and `getByRole('list', { name: 'Stops' })`; its source line ends "times from the timetable" or names a times clock.
- **Follow and line.** `panel.getByRole('button', { name: 'Follow' })`; `panel.getByRole('button', { name: 'Show whole line' })` raises `page.getByRole('button', { name: /^Showing: line .* · Clear$/ })`, whose click takes it down.
- **Follow and line, tilted.** Open `/en?map=14.00/<lat>/<lon>/-30.0/50.0&trip=<key>` on a trip's `position` from `/api/snapshot`. After Follow, hovering the viewport's middle shows the trip's card for seconds while `[data-vehicles]` keeps `data-tilt="50"` and `data-heading="-30"`. After Show whole line, once the address's zoom has dropped, it still ends `/-30.0/50.0`, and the screenshot shows the whole line between the top bar's chip and the legend, clear of the sheet and the panel.
- **Close.** `page.keyboard.press('Escape')`; the panel is hidden and `?trip=` gone.
- **Missing.** `page.goto('/en?trip=nothing')` opens `getByRole('dialog', { name: 'Trip not found' })`.
- **On the timetable source.** On a launch with `timetable` as the third argument, take a bus underway from `/api/snapshot` (`mode` `bus`, no `waiting`), open `/en?map=15.00/<lat>/<lon>` on its `position` and tap the middle inside `toPass()` until `getByRole('dialog', { name: /to <headsign>/ })` opens, the address with `?trip=`. It shows `Timetable only` and "No live positions yet; placed from the timetable.", `Delay` and `Last seen` read `—`, every item of `getByRole('list', { name: 'Stops' })` has a clock time with no `~` before it and no `+N` or `−N` after it, and the source line reads `Timetable · placed <time>`, the snapshot's minute with seconds; nowhere `Rejseplanen`, `position`, `times from the timetable` or `From the timetable`. Follow keeps the camera on the dot as on the recording. A Metro trip's (`mode` `metro`) `Delay` reads `Runs to an interval`, its stops have no times, and its source line is the same. On `/da` the line reads `Køreplan · placeret <time>` and the state "Ingen livepositioner endnu; placeret efter køreplanen." With `--phone` the same, the source line wrapping inside the sheet with no sideways scroll.
- **With SIRI-ET's delays.** On a launch with `updates:siri-et` as the third argument, take from `/api/snapshot` a bus with `"state":"estimated"`, a `delay` of 120 or more and no `cancelled`, and its answer from `/api/trips/<key>`. `page.goto('/en?trip=<key>')`: `getByRole('dialog', { name: /to <headsign>/ })` reads `Estimated` and "Estimated from the timetable and a delay of +N min", and its `Delay` fact `+N min` with the hidden words `N min late`, N the delay at its `Next stop` in whole minutes (that call's `expectedDeparture` minus its `departure` in the trip's answer, and the snapshot's `delay` for the trip, which is the delay at its next call). Each item of `getByRole('list', { name: 'Stops' })` whose expected time is a minute or more from its planned one reads the planned time, then `~` and the expected time (hidden `Expected HH:MM`); the source line reads `Timetable and Rejseplanen's delays · updated <time>`, the trip's `updated` with seconds; nowhere `placed` or "No live positions yet". A bus with a negative `delay` reads `−N min` and `N min early`. Once `/api/snapshot`'s `fetched` is past `2026-10-31T08:21:15Z` (09:21:15 in Copenhagen, about 22 minutes after launch; `expect.poll`), `page.goto('/en?trip=bus.68.bb4e5908a5.20261031.0916')` (bus 68 to Lyngby St.): its stop `Otto Mønsteds Plads (Rysensteensgade)` reads `Cancelled` and has `data-cancelled`, its other stops not. On `/da` the source line reads `Køreplan og Rejseplanens forsinkelser · opdateret <time>`, the delay `N min forsinket` or `N min før tid`, a skipped stop `Aflyst`. With `--phone` the same, the source line wrapping inside the sheet with no sideways scroll.

## Gotchas

- The Metro runs to an interval: its delay reads "Runs to an interval" and its stops have no times.
- A reload keeps the panel; the list loads again after the reload.
- With SIRI-ET's delays a trip with no update, and every Metro trip, reads as on the timetable source: `Timetable · placed <time>`.
- The timetable source runs at the real time on the deployed timetable, so which trips are underway, and where, is whatever the plan says at that moment: read them from `/api/snapshot` at drive time, never from the recording's keys. Late at night few buses run.
